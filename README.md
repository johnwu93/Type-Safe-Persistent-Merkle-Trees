# Presentation

I made a presentation for my impelementation. You can find it the directory `my-presentation/spectacle`.

Here are the instructions to run the presentation:

1. `cd my-presentation/spectacle`
2. `npm run build`
2. `npm start`

`npm start` should run a local server on `localhost:3060`. The slides was created with Spectacle.
